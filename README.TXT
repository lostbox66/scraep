scrAEp is a simple Python script which can be used to scrape websites for URLs recursively.

Here's an example of how one could use it:

python3 scraep.py --url https://drudgereport.com/ --depth 2 --output drudge.json

It grabs the URL, title and a timestamp of when it was scraped (UNIX format)
and jams it into a JSON file.

The AE stands for anti-ethical, or whatever you want it to. Have fun & don't be too evil.
